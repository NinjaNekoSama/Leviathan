## Project Title
**Killer Whale Call Detection Using Graph Neural Networks**

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust toolkit for detecting killer whale (orca) calls in underwater audio recordings using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The goal is to improve the accuracy of sound event detection (SED) in noisy and overlapping acoustic environments, providing a valuable tool for researchers and conservationists.

### 4. **Building the Classification Layer**
   - **Description**: Add a classification head to the model to predict the presence or absence of killer whale calls.
   - **Duration**: 1 month
   - **Deadline**: [Insert Deadline]
   - **Status**: [Not Started]

### 5. **Model Evaluation and Comparison**
   - **Description**: Evaluate the model's performance using quantitative metrics and compare it to existing models like ORCA-SPOT.
   - **Duration**: 1 month
   - **Deadline**: [Insert Deadline]
   - **Status**: [Not Started]

### 6. **Writing the Thesis Report**
