# 🐋Killer Whale Call Detection Using Graph Neural Networks🐋

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust toolkit for detecting killer whale (orca) calls in underwater audio recordings using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The goal is to improve the accuracy of sound event detection (SED) in noisy and overlapping acoustic environments, providing a valuable tool for researchers and conservationists.
